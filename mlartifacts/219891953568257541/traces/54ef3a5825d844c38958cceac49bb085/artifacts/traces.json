Label True if ANY spoiler, even minor, is present; otherwise, label False. Consider explicit plot details, twists, or endings as spoilers.\\n\\n### Modification Suggestions ###\\n\\n1. Specify the output format: Instruct the model to respond strictly with 'True' for spoiler-containing reviews and 'False' otherwise, with no additional explanation required. 2. Clarify what constitutes a 'spoiler': Add a guideline in the prompt defining spoilers as explicit plot revelations (major twists, character deaths, endings, etc.). 3. Emphasize review content focus: Explicitly state to ignore opinions on performances, cinematography, or pacing unless plot details are revealed. Example improved prompt: 'Does this movie review reveal plot details that would spoil the movie for someone who hasn't seen it? Respond with True if it contains any explicit plot revelations (e.g., character deaths, plot twists, endings) and False otherwise. Do not consider reviews that mention only cinematography, pacing, or performances without plot details.'\\n\\n###Instructions###\\n\\n1.
